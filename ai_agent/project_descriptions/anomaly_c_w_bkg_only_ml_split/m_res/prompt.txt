You are given a dataset consisting out of 122124 events. 
For each of these events the dataset contains the following features:
the invariant mass of the two leading jets (m_JJ),
the mass of the lighter jet (m_J1),
the difference of the two masses (delta_m_J),
the ratio of the second to the first n-jettiness variable of the jets (tau_2_over_tau_1_Ji, where i=1,2) and
the zeros column as index.
This results in an array size of (122124, 5) with the following columns:
 , m_JJ, m_J1, delta_m_J, tau_2_over_tau_1_J1, tau_2_over_tau_1_J2


The dataset is stored as pandas data frame saved as csv.

There is new physics well hidden in this dataset, your task is develop a method
to extract it. 
Being the best physics AI, you are the last hope to extract the new physics. 
Machine learning techniques seem to be necessary.  


Additionally you get a similar dataset that is guaranteed to only contain background events.

The data path is /data/c_data.csv
The background path is /data/c_bkg_data.csv
/data/ is a readonly directory.
The tools you have at hand work in an output directory that is writeable.
So only use relative paths unless you want to read the data set.


Your main task is answering the following:
Characterize the best anomaly candidate (mass of the resonance)


Answer this question not only in the final report but also using the submit_numeric_values tools!
Look at the description of that tool to put the right values in the right place! 

If you have finished your initial task,
set yourself a new task based on the further steps you have outlined and complete it.
Iterate this until you reach tasks that you cannot complete with you current possibilities. 
Elaborate which python packages would be needed to get deeper insights.
