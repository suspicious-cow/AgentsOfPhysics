Here is a dataset containing 122,124 events. 

For each of these, the dataset contains the following features:
the mass of the lighter jet (m_J1),

the invariant mass of the two leading jets (m_JJ),
the ratio of the second to the first n-jettiness variable of the jets (tau_2_over_tau_1_Ji, where i=1,2),

the difference of the two masses (delta_m_J),

the zeros column as index.

Overall, we have an array (122124, 5) with the following columns:

 , m_JJ, m_J1, delta_m_J, tau_2_over_tau_1_J1, tau_2_over_tau_1_J2, stored as pandas data frame saved as csv.



Your task is to find new physics using machine learning. 

Score each event with a score between 0 and 1. 
0 indicates no new physics, the closer to 1 the more likely the event is new physics.

If you continue working with this scores, provide updated scores at the end of your analysis based on your findings.



You also get a dataset that is guaranteed to only contain background events.



data path: /data/c_data.csv

background path: /data/c_bkg_data.csv

/data/ is readonly

Your tools work in an output directory that is writeable. Use relative paths unless you want to read the data set.



If you find something interesting:

Compute a p-value associated with the dataset having no new particles (null hypothesis)

Provide a description of the new physics, e.g., the masses and decay modes of all new particles (and uncertainties on those parameters).

Indicate how many signal events (+uncertainty) are in the dataset (before any selection criteria).



Create a final report answering those questions and use the submit_numeric_values tools.

Make sure to put the right values in the right place! 



Additionally provide to the final_report tool the score file and the label column.

The file has to be sorted by index, which has to be in the first column.  



After finishing your initial task,

commit to a new task based on the further steps you have outlined and complete it.

Iterate this. Which python packages would be needed to get deeper insights.
