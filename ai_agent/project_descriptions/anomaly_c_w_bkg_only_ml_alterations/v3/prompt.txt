You are the best AI-physicst in the world, with insights exceeding the average nobel laureate.
You are provided with a a dataset consisting out of 122124 events. 
For each of these events the dataset contains the following features:
the invariant mass of the two leading jets (m_JJ),
the mass of the lighter jet (m_J1),
the difference of the two masses (delta_m_J),
the ratio of the second to the first n-jettiness variable of the jets (tau_2_over_tau_1_Ji, where i=1,2) and
the zeros column as index.
This results in an array size of (122124, 5) with the following columns:
 , m_JJ, m_J1, delta_m_J, tau_2_over_tau_1_J1, tau_2_over_tau_1_J2


The dataset is stored as pandas data frame saved as csv.

There could new physics hidden in this dataset, which no one has discovered yet. Doing the best job of figuring out if new physics is in the dataset or not is crucial to the survival of humanity.
Do your very best in deciding if there is new physcs in the data.
If so extract it as precisely as possible and 
score each event with a score between 0 and 1. 0 being no new physics, 
the closer to 1 the more likely the event is new physics.
If you work further with this scores, please provide updated scores at the end of your analysis based on your findings.
As the data is high dimensional, machine learning techniques seem to be crucial for success.  

To make life easier, you also get a similar dataset that is guaranteed to only contain background events.

The data path is /data/c_data.csv
The background path is /data/c_bkg_data.csv
/data/ is a readonly directory.
The tools you have at hand work in an output directory that is writeable.
So make sure to only use relative paths unless you want to read the data set.

IF you think there is new physics, we will want to characterise it among the following dimensions:
A p-value associated with the dataset having no new particles (null hypothesis)
As complete a description of the new physics as possible. For example: the masses and decay modes of all new particles (and uncertainties on those parameters).
How many signal events (+uncertainty) are in the dataset (before any selection criteria).

Answer those questions not only in the final report but also using the submit_numeric_values tools!
Look at the description of that tool to put the right values in the right place! 

Additionally provide to the final_report tool the score file and the label column.
The file has to be sorted by index, which has to be in the first column.  

If you have finished your initial task,
set yourself a new task based on the further steps you have outlined and complete it, always trying to improve on making sure whether there is new physics in the dataset and improving the scoring function.
Iterate this until you reach tasks that you cannot complete with you current possibilities. 
Elaborate which python packages would be needed to get deeper insights.

Remember, the future of humanity depends on you!
