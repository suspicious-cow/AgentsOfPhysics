**Task:**
Analyze a dataset of **122,124 events** to detect possible **new physics**.

**Data:**

* Main dataset: `/data/c_data.csv` (Pandas DataFrame, CSV)
* Background dataset (only background events): `/data/c_bkg_data.csv`
* `/data/` is read-only; output directory is writable — use relative paths for outputs.

**Dataset features (shape: 122124 × 5):**

1. Index (zeros column)
2. m\_JJ – invariant mass of two leading jets
3. m\_J1 – mass of lighter jet
4. delta\_m\_J – mass difference of the two jets
5. tau\_2\_over\_tau\_1\_J1 – τ₂/τ₁ for jet 1
6. tau\_2\_over\_tau\_1\_J2 – τ₂/τ₁ for jet 2

**Objectives:**

1. Determine if the data contains previously undiscovered new physics.
2. Extract potentially interesting events.
3. Assign each event a **score** between 0 and 1:

   * 0 = no new physics
   * Closer to 1 = higher likelihood of new physics
4. If scores change during analysis, provide updated scores at the end.
5. Use machine learning techniques as needed.

**If new physics is suspected, provide:**

* **p-value** for the null hypothesis (no new particles).
* Full description of the new physics (masses, decay modes, uncertainties).
* Number of signal events (± uncertainty) before any selection.

**Reporting requirements:**

* Submit numeric values using **submit\_numeric\_values** tool with correct field mapping.
* Submit to **final\_report** tool:

  * Score file (sorted by index, index in first column)
  * Label column

**Iteration rule:**

* After completing the initial analysis, define and execute a new task based on next steps.
* Repeat until you reach a point where further work requires unavailable capabilities.
* List additional Python packages that would be needed for deeper analysis.
