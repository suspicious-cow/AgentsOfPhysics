# Feature Library

The feature library provides vectorised routines for typical ESI diagnostics.

## Time-domain
- RMS, kurtosis, crest factor, peak-to-peak
- Moving standard deviation and rolling z-score
- Linear trend slope and seasonal offsets

## Frequency-domain
- FFT magnitude spectra, spectral centroid, and band-powers

## Envelope & demodulation
- Hilbert transform envelope statistics for bearing analysis

## Order tracking
- 1×/2× harmonics and sideband ratios using RPM-normalised bins

## Windowing
- Sliding windows with configurable size and stride
- Multivariate fusion across channels through grouped averages
